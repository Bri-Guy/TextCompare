It is my theory that at some point in every person’s childhood, we develop an inexplicable craving for pets. I mean, sure, sisters and brothers are great, but will your cat ever argue with you or learn to blackmail you? Unless you own Garfield, I don’t think so.

For my older sister, the fantasy of owning a dog struck her in middle school; the idea of having a companion brimming with energy and always ready to play was endearing to us both. But my parents grew up running away from hounds on their way to school, so they strongly discouraged us from owning such beasts.

We eventually decided to buy something just as friendly and energetic as a dog: Carassius Auratus. In other words, the common goldfish. We bought 11 in total, each about the size of a penny. Caring for them turned out to be more complicated than we expected. Goldfish don’t have stomachs, so they’ll keep eating whatever they set their eyes on without feeling full. Unless we wanted to give every fish constipation, we would need to feed them often but in very small quantities. Replacing tank water each week was also critical, as ammonia buildup and oxygen deficiencies in water could severely damage the fish.

Over the course of a year and a bit of experimenting, the fish blossomed, nearly doubling in size and shimmering in gold and red like flames curling underwater. About two years after first meeting our fish, we embarked on a two-week vacation and entrusted our fish tank to one of my sister’s close friends, Mary. We taught her the basics of fostering them and provided extra packages of every supply imaginable.

The only problem was, Mary had seven siblings, ranging from kindergarten student to recent college graduate. We returned home to a fascinating sight in our tank: two fish lying upside down, and only one swimming around, the image resembling the burnt golden ashes of a fallen phoenix. The other eight fish were nowhere to be seen. As we listened to Mary’s explanations of fish jumping out of the tank and mysterious disappearances of the underwater creatures, I was consumed by an unexpected anger. How could my sister not know this would happen? How could Mary be cruel enough to try caring for the fish, knowing they would live as mere playthings?

But in retrospect, maybe it’s not so bad that we trusted Mary with the fish. Hopefully, she learned the value of standing by her word and treating others’ treasures as her own. I’d rather have her mistreat a dozen goldfish and learn from it than accidentally wipe years’ worth of work from a friends’ computer or agree to take on an impossible responsibility. As for my sister and I, we took in our last remaining fish and bought a few new companions for it; this time, we would put even more care in and breathe new life into our phoenix, our underwater kingdom of life.
